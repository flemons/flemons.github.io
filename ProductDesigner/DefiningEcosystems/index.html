Similar to templates, but not nearly as rigid, ecosystems give designers the groundwork to build off of, while not being limiting in edge cases.<br><br>

                                Think of it like interior design, best practices, and tactics to lay out your home beautifully but generally not prescriptive and “cut-and-paste”.

                                Further <strong>over 90% of the actions users completed on Geotab could be distilled to half a dozen ecosystems.</strong> From these half a dozen ecosystems, <strong>less than 5 percent of users found any of them a positive experience</strong> in a UMUX study we ran.

Surfaced in my previous work in centralizing safety, Geotab’s methods of navigation were cumbersome for all users. The primary navigation in particular had <strong>50+ links organized without any consistency.</strong><br><br>

                                Navigation across the product was Geotab’s <strong>number 1 most requested improvement </strong> from both resellers and customers. This made it the strongest candidate to serve as the proof of concept. A month-long initiative led by myself defined a new navigation structure and planet-to-city data org. <br><br>

                                <strong>The result was a task-focused IA that improved UMUX across the product by 5% and increased page-to-page engagement by 18%.</strong> UMUX lite became the primary metric moving forward, with pattern-specific metrics applied where needed.

Establishing how we function as a team became critical to ensure overlapping efforts are flagged, provide opportunities for feedback, and give team members the chance to collaborate.

                            <p class="content">The initial scope of work was ecosystems for data manipulation and data presentation. These were quite broad and agnostic of specific use cases (but having a few as examples for testing). This enabled a full rethink of prioritized ecosystems for both desktop and mobile such as tables, filtering, loading, and more. <br><br>

                                As ecosystems were further refined, a space was needed to test the ecosystems for a broader roll-out. The asset page was chosen for its reliance on ecosystems for displaying and manipulating content.

                                <strong>Pre-discussions, there were over 40 specific feature requests from the product org. Post, it had been reduced to 3.</strong>

The roll-out showed a promising <strong>improvement of 15% to UMUX on the assets page</strong>. <br><br>
                                In testing, there was over a <strong>50% lower failure rate</strong> on tasks and extremely positive feedback from participants. The improvements also were built to the AA web accessibility standards, an issue plaguing the company for years.
