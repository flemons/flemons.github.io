                                Collaborating with data science and using our safety journey map as a guide, <strong>3 key steps were defined that help tell a story to customers instead of an information dump</strong>. Exploration into interpreted versus raw data yielded a simpler data set, enabling users “at a glance” to understand their fleet's safety.

                            <p class="content">Originally released in beta, users engaged with more of the product than ever before. Engagement on through-way pages (that present more data related to safety) <strong> at a minimum increased by 200%.</strong>.<br><br>

                                From the user testing conducted 100% of the users claimed they would use the safety center in their day to day. In the 10,000+ user pool we released the beta too, we saw <strong>nearly a quarter of users who used the safety center return to it weekly.</strong><br><br>

                                These positive metrics have led to a roll-out of additional “centers” that follow the story defined in this first pass and a company shift from raw data density to interpreted data transparency. <br><br>

                                The negative metric of low overall safety center engagement was caused by convoluted navigation, which catalyzed the design system pattern project.

                                <li><strong>Have a plan for resources:</strong> Having a discrete plan of where dedicated design and development resources would focus, as well as integrating pattern work where possible into pre-existing projects, made for a far easier pitch.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignment to avoid burnout:</strong> One of the largest challenges in the process was resourcing, with design, product, and development being pulled in different directions. The regular check-ins with teams alleviated this, as well as giving myself the opportunity to work with members to prioritize work, clarify direction, and help where necessary.</li>
