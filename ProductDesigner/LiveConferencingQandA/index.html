                                The lifecycle of a question carried through most design decisions, with both the aforementioned columns of a question state, as well as pre-event controls to allow as much time as possible for users to review questions before answering the audience.

                                From an attendee perspective, their interface was extremely stripped back with all actions for the user constrained to one place (Q&amp;A, voting, additional materials). Users were also given transparency into their questions by viewing simplified states.
