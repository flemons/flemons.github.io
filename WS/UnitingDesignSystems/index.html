                                Our users saw changes so infrequently that they had become <em>extremely</em> resistent to change. So much so that <strong>we had to maintain 8 previous versions of our core product.</strong><br><br>

                                Many factors contributed to this monolothic release cycle, but a primary one was <strong>everyone was building something different.</strong><br><br>
                                From within my first few weeks at Geotab it was evident that the company wanted to change, we just needed a focus.

                                To get development’s involvement early, Jira became the workhorse for tracking and delegating. Figma’s design system metrics became the defacto understanding for prioritzation, eventually utilizing the branch/merge process to improve contribution.

                                Active contribution style resulted in efficient workshops, consolidating group understanding of design systems in their respective products today. This more active workshop moved async after each session as electrons and atoms were consolidated by myself.

                                Coinciding with the transition of multiple products to react, the design system would serve as the guide for teams to migrate to the new library.

Engagement with the primary design system also nearly quadrupled, as we deprecated 3 of the conflicting design systems, leaving 2 others for product-specific components (which were connected to the primary design system). <br><br>

                                The developed design system is still in testing but with promising results from all of the opted-in external developers. Documentation has led to extensive discussion and knowledge-sharing, while the finalized NPM package is still being completed.<br><br>

                                As the design system is constantly growing, short and long-term roadmaps were created that would follow the development of the design system. Additional metrics and accompanying goals were also constructed to gauge the effectiveness of the design system from a development and design perspective moving forward.
